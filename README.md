Set MythTV recordings using TitanTV and your calendar

Under construction

MythRecCal is a script that can be set to run daily on a MythTV backend computer which allows setting recordings from other devices using titantv.com.  TitanTV provides free online guide information, and the site allows several methods for interacting with computers that have DVR software.  One of the options on TitanTV for each guide listing is to add the program information to your personal calendar.  MythRecCal checks your calendar and sets a corresponding recording in MythTV for each program added.
